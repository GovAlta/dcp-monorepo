It provides them with the ability to search, create, update, and delete records in real time, directly from their business applications, without accessing 1GX directly.\n\nThis service must be requested by 1GX ministry service managers, as they are responsible for the integrations between 1GX and ministry applications. They will work with application developers, the 1GX Centre of Excellence (CoE) team, and the Service Integration team to determine which API(s) will meet business area requirements.\n\nThe 1GX CoE team approves requests for this service and collaborates with the Service Integration team to collect the requirements needed to configure API Gateway access and security roles",
