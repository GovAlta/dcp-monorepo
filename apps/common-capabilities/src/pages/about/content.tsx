          Common capabilities represent the common and shared components that
          drive interoperability across teams and promote delivery of efficient
          digital services to Albertans by the Government of Alberta.
        </p>
        <p>
          The common capabilities platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools
          and technologies that accelerate development processes and facilitate
          better integration within our digital eco-system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tools and technologies listed on the common capabilities site are
          referred to as services. All product teams, platform teams, and
          portfolio teams contribute to the common capabilities platform by
          sharing the digital services that are reusable, trusted, and reliable.

            Teams can discover and explore the tools and technologies built by
            enterprise, platforms, product, and portfolio teams on one single
            platform and utilize it to build future services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reusing existing services, code, and components can save time and
            budget, streamline processes, improve developer productivity, and
            help us in building better, faster, smarter services.

            By utilizing existing digital services that are reliable,
            user-centered, and meet security standards, teams can ensure
            consistent service performance with minimal disruptions while
            safeguarding the personal and sensitive information of all

          As we continue to develop and implement a government-wide digital
          strategy, it is essential that we employ engineering practices that
          meet our digital strategy objectives to ensure Albertan’s can trust
          our digital offerings.

          Common capabilities not only allow the teams to operate more
          efficiently but also enables the Government of Alberta to deliver
          modern, reliable, and secure digital experiences to all Albertans.  
        </p>
        <p>
          By utilizing common capabilities, we are participating and supporting
          the government’s effort and initiatives to make the life of Albertans
          better.
