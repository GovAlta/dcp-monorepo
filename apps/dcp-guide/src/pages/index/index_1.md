**About the Playbook**
----------------------

The Government of Alberta (GoA) Digital Delivery Playbook (“the Playbook”) is **the home of digital service delivery at the GoA.** It describes **how we work with ministry partners**, the kind of **problems we can solve** together, and the **principles** that guide this work.

It’s also a **jumping-off point for product teams** across the GoA who are seeking **practical guidance** that will help them ramp up quickly and deliver consistently high quality services for Albertans.

We are designing the Playbook using the same principles we use to design and develop great services. This means that you can expect the Playbook to evolve over time as we learn more about you_._
