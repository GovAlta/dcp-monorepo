From early strategic decisions to prototyping and going live, these principles inform the way that we work at every stage of the process.

      We put user needs at the centre of service delivery. Users may include Albertans, internal GoA staff, and anyone who has a stake in the way that the service is delivered.

        From the outset of every project, we identify and work directly with users to understand their experience. Sometimes we map the user service journey to identify needs and challenges that users encounter.
        
        We continue to engage users throughout the whole digital delivery process, testing the service with real users, and incorporating our findings.

        Modern service delivery requires modern ways of working. We are transforming the Government of Alberta into an organization that can deliver world-class digital services.

          This means shifting the way that we work to reduce bureaucracy, empower agile product teams to make decisions, increase digital literacy, and inspire transformation that endures beyond product delivery.

            We use agile methods to design, develop, test, and iterate possible solutions with users.

We don't fixate on one potential solution; instead, we explore possible ideas with users early and often, incorporating findings from usability testing along the way. Our priority is to place something of value in the user's hands as quickly and as often as possible.

        A modern digital service should be transparent and accountable, both to the public and internally among government stakeholders. 

We are open about our process, sharing our work in progress, tools, standards, and code freely with Albertans and the broader service sector across the country. It also means we communicate openly about our successes and failures.

      We consider the start-to-finish journey users take to complete their objective. 

        We endeavour to create a resilient and seamless service experience for Albertans across digital and physical channels. In some cases, this may include changes to policies and legislation, processes, and ways in which users interact with the service.

    We build ecosystems to meet the constant evolution of user needs and technology. 

      This means starting small and scaling up, developing compatible common components, and judiciously choosing the right tool for the job. We believe in being frugal with Albertans’ tax dollars, and endeavour to leverage existing components of the ecosystem wherever possible.

          We respect that Albertans have entrusted us to handle their personal information with care. We recognize that people own their personal data and have a stake in how the government uses that information.

            In partnership with the Cybersecurity Services and Data, Information and Privacy Services Divisions of Service Alberta, we are committed to implementing privacy, security, and data management best practices that are in line with industry standards and Albertans’ evolving expectations of digital services.

        We humbly acknowledge that societal inequities exist and recognize that these inequities can—often unintentionally—manifest in an organizational setting. We are dedicated to policies and practices that strive to mitigate inequities before they happen and confront them if they inadvertently arise. We consider accessibility and diversity as foundational design criteria for any public service. We are committed to designing inclusive government services that prioritize the experiences of users with distinct needs.

              We acknowledge the complex historical relationship that the government has with Indigenous peoples and endeavour to work in the spirit of reconciliation in every project.
