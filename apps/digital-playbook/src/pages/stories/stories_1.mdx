        **We are just beginning to share our stories.**
-----------------------------------------------

The obvious stories are those that describe the impact of our work on service metrics like user satisfaction or cost per transaction.

We also want to tell the stories about **the people** who are doing this work so that we might accurately document our transformation into a modern, resilient, and responsive institution. This means sharing what we try, what we learn, and how we grow and change.
