---------------

Digital service initiatives are delivered as a partnership between Technology and Innovation and a Ministry Partner. The Product Owner is an employee of the Ministry Partner, while all other roles are part of Digital Design and Delivery.

Both Technology and Innovation and the Ministry Partner commit to a collaborative processâ€”aligning strategy and sharing knowledge, skills, and expertise at every stage of the process.

Our most successful partnerships happen when Ministry Partners are committed to fundamentally re-orienting services towards user needs, and when Product Teams do the hard work to make things simple to use and understand.
