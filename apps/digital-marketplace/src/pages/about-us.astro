                        <h2>Who we are</h2>
                        <p>The Alberta Digital Marketplace is a platform to connect government buyers with private sector vendors and innovators, fostering collaboration, efficiency, and economic growth. As part of the Ministry of Technology and Innovation (TI), we are the driving force behind Alberta's digital transformation. We partner with ministries and stakeholders to design and develop smarter, better, faster digital services through user-centered design and agile development practices. With dozens of in-flight projects each year, we are committed to reducing the digital divide.</p>
                        <p>Alberta has a growing digital and technology sector sustained by strong academic and industry collaborations, a young and highly skilled workforce and long-term sustainable investments in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other technologies critical to our success and global competitiveness. Through the Digital Marketplace we will explore ways to enhance procurement and collaboration, and delivery world-class digital services that are easy to use, fast, efficient, and secure.</p>
